A key advantage of this solution is that it can greatly reduce a lot of the frustration when managing multiple databases over erratic networks because of its automation capabilities.\n\n\nYou will encounter two terms that are used throughout this document and also when using Conductor4SQL. These terms are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClient\n - A Client is a remote instance of SQL server that is controlled by Conductor4SQL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral server\n - A Central server is a standalone instance of SQL Server on which Conductor4SQL is installed. Typically, a Central server would be installed at a Head Office or Data Centre location     that has the required network connectivity to all client servers. Details of the connectivity requirement is discussed in the \nClient pre-requisites\n topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Features\n\n\nUsing Conductor4SQL offers considerable technical features that you can perform from a single point, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentralised Query Capabilities\n - You can retrieve data simultaneously from an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances and consolidate, view or export the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentralised Command Capabilities\n - You can conduct database version control and make simultaneous metadata changes to an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances, such as using DDL, DML.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentralised File Distribution Capabilities\n - You can send files of any type to an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances simultaneously, such as DLL's, batch files and others. A concise record of files sent is maintained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentralised Data Synchronisation\n - You can consolidate and synchronise data simultaneously on an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances.
