A key advantage of this solution is that it can greatly reduce a lot of the frustration when managing multiple databases over erratic networks because of its automation capabilities. You will encounter two terms that are used throughout this document and also when using Conductor4SQL. These terms are: Client - A Client is a remote instance of SQL server that is controlled by Conductor4SQL. Central server - A Central server is a standalone instance of SQL Server on which Conductor4SQL is installed. Typically, a Central server would be installed at a Head Office or Data Centre location that has the required network connectivity to all client servers. Details of the connectivity requirement is discussed in the Client pre-requisites topic. Technical Features Using Conductor4SQL offers considerable technical features that you can perform from a single point, including: Centralised Query Capabilities - You can retrieve data simultaneously from an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances and consolidate, view or export the results. Centralised Command Capabilities - You can conduct database version control and make simultaneous metadata changes to an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances, such as using DDL, DML. Centralised File Distribution Capabilities - You can send files of any type to an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances simultaneously, such as DLL's, batch files and others. A concise record of files sent is maintained. Centralised Data Synchronisation - You can consolidate and synchronise data simultaneously on an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances. This can also be used for central reporting purposes. Schema Comparison - You can obtain a concise and searchable list of differences between database structures (which includes tables, stored procedures, functions, views and constraints) \u2014 across all client servers. Centralised Auditing - You can audit all the above features plus DDL and security events that occur on an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances. This is key to enforcing database version control including complete visibility of all activity occurring in your SQL environment. Data Recovery - Provides Disaster Recovery Management ensuring data is recoverable, even if no MS-SQL backups are available. Getting Started The content of this manual is intended to provide the user with the following information: What is required to install the Conductor4SQL system? \u2014 See the central server pre-requisites and the client server pre-requisites How do I install the Conductor4SQL system? - See the central server installation and client server installation guide How do I administer the Conductor4SQL system and edit settings? \u2014 See administration overview .

An example of objects would be Create login , Create database , Create table , Drop stored procedure , Alter view , etc. This feature is extremely useful for establishing when an object was created, altered or dropped in your SQL environment and also who did it and when it was done. Additionally, Conductor4SQL allows you to create audit alerts where you can setup alerts for these audit events to pro-actively monitor your SQL server environment for specific events. e.g. you could easily set up an alert to notify you when database POS is dropped.

Here are some examples of what you might want to do here: You want to run a query to check the status of all your client side databases. - See Send User Query section You want to alter a table at all your in-country stores. - See Send User Command section You want to ensure that all your table meta-data and stored procedures are identical across your entire environment. - See Send System Query section You want to enable DDL Event Auditing at all your in-country stores as a core stored procedure keeps changing and you want to find the culprit. - See Send System Command section You have Word document you want to send to all your clients stores updating all the store operators on the latest corporate policy. - See Send File section. You have a day end Excel extract at 1000+ stores that you would like to pull to the Central server rather connecting to each server individually. - See File Pull section You sent out a User Query to all of in country stores and you want to see everywhere where that query failed. - See Central Client Control History Tip Ensure that the list of status results on display are updated by clicking the Refresh button. Send user Commands and Queries User Commands are used for DDL (data definition language) which is used for manipulating data structures within the databases at the clients. User Queries are used for querying information from the clients. Send User Command To send a User Command click on the Send Command button and choose which clients you would like to send the command to from the context menu (All, Group or Some) Enter your script in the Script Editor form Tip Please view our Script Editor Guide for more information on the Script Editor Warning If your query has multiple result sets only the first result set is returned from each client Click of the Submit button to send the command. The Monitor Request screen will give you a status update on the sent message. Tip You can close this window at any time by clicking on the close button and your message will still be sent to the client and processed in the background. The Status and colors work the same way as The Status Grid below. Send User Query To send a User Query click on the Send Query button and choose which clients you would like to send the command to from the context menu (All, Group or Some) Enter your script in the Script Editor form Tip Please view our Script Editor Guide for more information on the Script Editor Click of the Submit button to send the command. The Monitor Request screen will give you a status update on the sent message. Tip You can close this window at any time by clicking on the close button and your message will still be sent to the client and processed in the background. The Status and colors work the same way as The Status Grid above. User Query Results The User Query Results view is simply all the results from each client's query combined into a single view. To get the Query Results you need to either: Click on the View All button or right click on the selected clients in the Details Grid and select the View Results option Note Query results are only available on the User Query Status and System Query Status tabs. The Client Name and Business Attribute columns are prefixed onto the existing result columns. Tip You can filter and group the results however you wish. For more information on the grid control capabilities view the Grid Control Guide . If you right click on the grid you will get a context menu: Add To Group - Add the selected client to a Client Group Open Client - Open the Client Console for the selected client You also have two export options: Export to File - will export the results to a Xlsx, Pdf or Html file Export to Table - export the results to a physical sql table (useful for advanced queries). Send system Commands and Queries System Commands - are pre-configured commands for controlling and checking Conductor4SQL clients. E.g. Client Pulse Check and Remove top (N) messages from Client Queue System Queries - pre-defined queries mostly used for metadata compare. E.g. Client Differences - Procedures Send System Command To send a System Command select the command from the System Commands drop down list, Click on the Execute Command button and choose which clients you would like to send the command to from the context menu (All, Group or Some). The available system commands are: Client Pulse Check - Pulse checks are used to check if a client is alive and accessible Remove Top (N) Messages From Client Queue - Remove error messages from the queue Enable Client Queue - Enable the selected queue at the client Disable Client Queue - Disable the selected queue at the client Get Client Report Data - Get report data for all of the activated reports Get Enterprise Sync Data - Get Enterprise Sync data sync data Enable Client Event Notifications - Enable client event auditing for the selected clients Disable Client Event Notifications - Disable client event auditing for the selected clients Client Pulse Check This command's prime objective is to check if a client is active and return a status condition. This condition will display the operational status of the Client on the Dashboard. Remove Top (n) messages from Client Queue This command is used to clean up a Client Queue if there are problematic messages that still exist. You may choose the number of messages you want to remove from the top end of the list. This command requests that you enter some relevant information about the removal such as the: Number of message to remove - Number of messages to remove from the queue Re-enable the client queue - Toggle to enable or disable re-enabling the queue after removing the messages * Reason - The reason for removing the messages Tip Use a descriptive reason when removing messages Queue Name - the queue to remove the messages from Enable Client Queue This command enables any Client which may be in a disabled condition. Clients are normally disabled when a bad SQL command is submitted. Disable Client Queue This command disables the Client queue which is useful if you want to send messages to a client but you do not want the client to process the messages at this point in time. Enable Client Event Notification This command enables client DDL auditing events, then there will be a trace on any event happening at the client. - See Auditing page for more information Disable Client Event Notification This command's prime objective is to disable the client DDL events, meaning once disabled then there will not be any client events recorded for that client the command is send to. Get Enterprise Sync Data This command retrieves any outstanding Enterprise sync data from the client to the central. Get Client Report Data If reports are enabled then this command will then fetch report data to the central in order to update the client reporting. Send System Query To send a System Query select the query from the System Queries drop down list, Click on the Execute Command button and choose which clients you would like to send the command to from the context menu (All, Group or Some).
