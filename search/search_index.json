A key advantage of this solution is that it can greatly reduce a lot of the frustration when managing multiple databases over erratic networks because of its automation capabilities.\n\n\nYou will encounter two terms that are used throughout this document and also when using Conductor4SQL. These terms are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClient\n - A Client is a remote instance of SQL server that is controlled by Conductor4SQL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral server\n - A Central server is a standalone instance of SQL Server on which Conductor4SQL is installed.
