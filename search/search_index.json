A key advantage of this solution is that it can greatly reduce a lot of the frustration when managing multiple databases over erratic networks because of its automation capabilities. You will encounter two terms that are used throughout this document and also when using Conductor4SQL. These terms are: Client - A Client is a remote instance of SQL server that is controlled by Conductor4SQL. Central server - A Central server is a standalone instance of SQL Server on which Conductor4SQL is installed. Typically, a Central server would be installed at a Head Office or Data Centre location that has the required network connectivity to all client servers. Details of the connectivity requirement is discussed in the Client pre-requisites topic. Technical Features Using Conductor4SQL offers considerable technical features that you can perform from a single point, including: Centralised Query Capabilities - You can retrieve data simultaneously from an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances and consolidate, view or export the results. Centralised Command Capabilities - You can conduct database version control and make simultaneous metadata changes to an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances, such as using DDL, DML. Centralised File Distribution Capabilities - You can send files of any type to an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances simultaneously, such as DLL's, batch files and others. A concise record of files sent is maintained. Centralised Data Synchronisation - You can consolidate and synchronise data simultaneously on an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances. This can also be used for central reporting purposes. Schema Comparison - You can obtain a concise and searchable list of differences between database structures (which includes tables, stored procedures, functions, views and constraints) \u2014 across all client servers. Centralised Auditing - You can audit all the above features plus DDL and security events that occur on an unlimited number of dispersed SQL instances. This is key to enforcing database version control including complete visibility of all activity occurring in your SQL environment. Data Recovery - Provides Disaster Recovery Management ensuring data is recoverable, even if no MS-SQL backups are available. Getting Started The content of this manual is intended to provide the user with the following information: What is required to install the Conductor4SQL system? \u2014 See the central server pre-requisites and the client server pre-requisites How do I install the Conductor4SQL system? - See the central server installation and client server installation guide How do I administer the Conductor4SQL system and edit settings? \u2014 See administration overview .

The example below shows a Conductor4SQL environment where are no issues: We also have an example of a typical large environment with some errors: A pre-defined Client Pulse Check is broadcast every 15 minutes to check if all clients are alive and communicating. The results of these checks are used to update the dashboard metrics. The overall state of your environment should preferably indicate 100% (all green lights). However, if there are problem indicators, scrutinise the metrics below to identify any issues. You click on any of the Red Icons and click on the View Details option to open a Detailed Report on that metrics errors. Tip if you want only want the metrics for a specific client group use the Filter With Group drop down list in the top left corner of the tab.

Central Health Clients Communication Overview Metric Description This indicator tells you the number of clients installed compared to the number of clients that are currently communicating. You want to try and keep this number to as close to 100% as possible. Service Running Metric Description This metric is important because it tells us if the Conductor4SQL Service is running. Its important that this service is always running as it is responsible for sending out scheduled User Commands and Queries as well as running the diagnostic tool for determining why clients are behind. Report Queue Enabled Metric Description It is important that the report queue is enabled at all times otherwise no report data will be populated for any of the clients. Clients Behind Metric Description These metrics display the number of client message queues that have been unavailable for the time shown. Queues Client Central Queues Down Metric Description This metric indicates the number of clients with queues that are down at central. This metric should always be Green . If it is Red then one or more clients have queues that are down at central. Please contact EnterpriseWorx support at support@ewx.co.za if this problem persists Client Queues Down Metric Description This metric indicates the number of clients with queues that are down at the client.

Conductor4SQL supports multiple synchronisation configurations: Consolidation Multiple databases at multiple clients are synchronised and consolidated at central to a single central database. One-to-one database(s) for a single client are synchronised at central each in its own database. Data synchronisation normally requires that the SQL servers storing the databases are always connected. However, when taking Conductor4SQL's guaranteed messaging queuing architecture is into account then this requirement is not necessary. Note If some distributed SQL servers are disconnected at the time of Data Synchronisation, Conductor4SQL will automatically initiate the synchronisation when the connection is re-established without any human intervention. If there are no network/infrastructure issues then the data will always synchronised and up to date. The Data Synchronisation feature applies significant data compression to reduce bandwidth usage by up to 20 times, which improve the speed of Data Synchronisation and thus make it resilient across erratic and slow networks. As a result, this makes it a solution where other traditional data replication technologies fail or have significant challenges. Note this is dependent on the data types being synchronised Pre-requisites for Data Synchronisation For any table to be synchronised and consolidated with another there are a few pre-requisite requirements: The database structure must be the same. The table names must be the same. The table must contain a primary key. If the table contains any of the following column types these columns will not be synced: sql_variant Data Sync Types Scheduled Sync Scheduled sync is the default and most popular data sync type. It works by creating a complete duplicate of each synced table, from the duplicate table it can calculate the deltas of the changes, which gets sent to the central server. This sync type also works well even if the source database is restored from a backup for example. The source database is not structurally altered in any way, however, this sync type uses a largest amount of disk space when compared with the other data sync types. This data sync type is available for all versions of SQL Server (2005 to 2019 and Express to Enterprise edition) Enterprise Sync Enterprise sync uses an underlying SQL Server technology called Change Data Capture or CDC for short. It uses the SQL Log Reader to mine changes from the SQL Log file and captures all synced table DML changes into change tracking tables. Conductor4SQL calculates the deltas from these change tracking tables and sends them to the central server. This data sync type is only available for SQL Server Enterprise Edition or SQL Server 2016 SP1 Standard Edition or greater. Once-Off Sync Once-Off sync is unique in that it isn't really a data sync type but rather a data sync initial snapshot. The content of synced table is sent to central but thereafter no deltas are captured, hence the name Once-Off sync. This sync type is very useful for syncing data that never changes. Real-Time Sync Real-Time sync as its name implies works in a near real-time fashion. This is achieved through the use of DML triggers. As a DML change occurs the trigger calculates the delta and sends it to the central server. This sync type is only suitable for very small to medium sized tables (tables less than 1 million rows). Additionally each SQL login that interacts with the synced table also requires additional permissions as the trigger interacts with stored procedures and queues stored in another database.

Step 4: Ensure that SQL version is MS SQL 2008 or higher is installed - If this fails you will need to upgrade your server to minimum requirements as per the central requirements document. Step 5: Ensure that MS SQL edition is standard or higher - Central cannot be installed on an express instance. Step 6: Ensure that the current SQL user is in the sysadmin user group - You require a user with sys-admin rights to install Conductor4SQL Step 7: Ensure that service broker is enabled - Service broker must be enabled on the SQL Server, you can run the following script to enable service broker.
